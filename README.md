## Purpose

This is a playground for mentoring sessions
Currently this playground serves as a serverless typescript playground to explore functions and the logic around it

## Getting Started

1. Using `yarn` - you'll want to run `yarn install` to allow for all node modules to be installed
2. Run `yarn start` - this will spin up the serverless environment in an offline state locally allowing you to access the functions and handlers via `http://localhost:3000`

## Scripts

- `start` - builds and starts the serverless offline environment locally
- `build` - builds the typescript environment and creates the `./out` directory
